# MQTT-Based Industrial IoT Gateway

Yocto-generated gateway image that polls serial telemetry from Modbus or CAN simulation, parses frames, and publishes cloud updates over MQTT/TLS.

## Portfolio Purpose

This repository is an Embedded Systems project scaffold for the Rheslar portfolio. It is designed to become a hardware-backed project with build output, validation logs, and reviewable implementation evidence.

All generated Embedded Systems repos are C++17-first and are framed around C++ design patterns and SOLID design principles.

## Stack

- C++17
- C++ Design Patterns
- SOLID
- Yocto
- MQTT
- TLS
- Modbus
- CAN
- Serial telemetry

## Quick Start

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/mqtt_industrial_iot_gateway
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Implementation Slices

- C++17 starter executable that exposes the project identity, stack, and validation target.
- Small strategy-style readiness check that keeps the scaffold aligned with C++ design patterns.
- Architecture document with control boundaries, data flow, safety assumptions, and evidence plan.
- CTest smoke test that keeps source, docs, and CI files present as the repo grows.
- GitHub Actions workflow for configure, build, executable smoke run, and repository validation.

## Evidence Target

Industrial protocol bridging, hardened Linux image ownership, secure MQTT publishing, and cloud-ready telemetry flow.

## C++17, Design Patterns, and SOLID Implementation

This repository includes a host-buildable C++17 implementation, not only documentation. The implementation applies:

- Strategy pattern for validation rules.
- Adapter interfaces for input samples and telemetry/reporting.
- Composite validation for combining safety and readiness checks.
- Facade orchestration through the project runtime class.
- SOLID boundaries between profile data, input acquisition, validation, telemetry encoding, and tests.
